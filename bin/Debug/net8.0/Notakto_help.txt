Objective:
- Force your opponent to complete three X's in a row on last one of the three boards.

Game Rules:
1. Players take turns placing X's on any of three 3x3 boards
2. When a board has three X's in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), that board is "dead" and no more moves can be made on it
3. The player who completes the third line (makes the third board "dead") loses the game

Controls:

   - Rows 4-6: Board 2
   - Rows 7-9: Board 3
